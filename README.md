# Project-1-FYS4150

This is Project 1 for the course FYS4150 at the University of Oslo, autumn 2021.
The collaborators are Marcus Moen and Thorstein Skaug



Notes on running the programs:

1. The last part of the main cpp file is commented out. This is because it would append further unwanted values to the text files for calculation times. If you want to run it, make sure to remove the text lines added to the time(n)n.txt file you write to.
